# event-popper

A Node.js package and a deployable REST API to update Event Pop event
description programmatically.

This can be useful for, e.g. continuously deploying an Event Pop description
page from a Git repository.

## REST API

_Under construction_

Using a REST API is a useful and more secure method that offers protection of
your session ID. (A session ID can be used to do _anything_ to every event the
user has access to, while the REST API only allows updating the description of
one event)
